# Phone Price Prediction Neural Network



### This project is using this problem found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification).


## About Dataset
### Context
Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.

Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.

In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is

## What I did was merely a classification 
But this neural network could also do the prediction for the test dataset.


## Precision results:

    Train Accuracy: 100.00%
    Validation Accuracy: 89.50%
    Test Accuracy: 94.00%

Soon more Images of the application will be added.

This project was developed largely based on the nnfs book and online course available on youtube.
