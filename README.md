# Phone Price Prediction Neural Network

## This is a university project

### This project is using this problem found on: 
    kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

For now, I am still working on the foundtions for this project, but when I get the results, data and graphics (and possibly a presentation), I'll put them here on this readme. For now, you can check my other projects.


## Precision results:

    Train Accuracy: 100.00%
    Validation Accuracy: 89.50%
    Test Accuracy: 94.00%

Soon more Images of the application will be added.
